This is an open-book **checkpoint** assessment focusing on building a simple To-Do List ruby app using ActiveRecord with SQL database.

The intention of this assessment is to establish an awareness for your current understanding and how would you progress more effectively in the coming week. Once you're aware your points of improvement, you can spend more time during the weekend to improve. **There is no pass or fail cases so breath out.** Chillax. =)

Included is the todo framework for the assessment, sourced and upgraded from NEXTAcademy "Ar-ToDo" skeleton.

# Purpose
The test is to ensure you are familiar with the basic of ActiveRecord working with the database like sqlite3 using Ruby. At the end of the assessment, you should be able to:

1) Understand ActiveRecord and How it Works

    1.1) Able to answer what ActiveRecord is
    1.2) Able to answer what ActiveRecord Model and Controllers
    1.3) Able to show how to use Model from ActiveRecord

2) Apply ActiveRecord and Sqlite3 into ruby application

    2.1) Able to show how to use and integrate sqlite3 with ActiveRecord
    2.2) Able to create and migrate a migration file
    2.3) Able to explore sqlite3 database through Ruby Model without using SQL statement.
    2.4) Able to create SQL database table through Ruby Model without using SQL statement.
    2.5) Able to CRUD data into SQL database through Ruby Model without using SQL statement.

3) Knows the critical points during application development.

> Critical points:
>
> Refers to naming (Capitalization, camel case etc), filename, classes, relation etc.


    3.1) Able to explain and show critical points for migration files
    3.2) Able to explain and show critical points for database table creation
    3.3) Able to explain and show critical points for model and database relation

4) Able to arrange your Object Classes according to MVC frameworks (Optional - Only when you have time)

> **Note**:
> 
> If you do not wish to pursue this section, you can squeeze everything inside your controller folder, leaving the 
> view folder empty.

    4.1) Able to find information to learn about MVC models.
    4.2) Able to arrange control type classes into controller folder.
    4.3) Able to arrange model type classes into model folder.
    4.4) Able to arrange printer type classes into views folder.
    4.5) Able to operate all classes from all MVC folders.


# Objectives
The main objective for this assessment is to achieve your ToDo App exercise designated by your mentor. This supplied framework should give you a quick start for developing your ruby code.

> Note:
>
> You'll be exposed to GIT version control software.
>
> For the GIT related question, ALWAYS ask your mentor to help you out.
>
> **Do not waste time exploring during the assessment time.**


# Assessment Time
Maximum **5 hours**

# Preparation
1) Coordinate with your mentors for setting up your assessment.


2) Fork this repo out by clicking the "Fork" button on the top on the GitHub page. Ask help when needed.


3) Open a new terminal for your assessment.


4) Access to desktop.
```
$ cd ~/Desktop
```
<br />
5) Execute a cloning from your own repo.
```
$ git clone <your repo address>
```
<br />
6) Enter the repo.
```
$ cd <repo-name>
```
<br />
7) Begin your test
> Note:
>
> Remember to commit small and often. Some good references:
>
> ```$ git add <filename>```
>
> ```$ git commit -m "your commit messages```
>
> ```$ git push```
>
> Ask mentor if you're bound into git issue.
<br />

> **Important Note**:
>
> You should write your main functions inside "**todo.rb**" file.
>
> Then, you can create Additional class object files and place them inside controllers/models/views depending on its nature.
>
> User will execute only "**ruby todo.rb**" to run your app.


    7.1) Explore and try to understand the framework, observe the structure. (See Tips)
    7.2) Observe the demo codes and figure out how they require one another.
    7.3) Once done, begin your coding.

>**TIP**:
>
> There is one missing folder for database migration.
> Perhaps you can check out your past homework in regards of the missing folder.

<br />
8) Once done, perform your last "git push" to your repo.

9) Inform your mentor with the GitHub link.

10) Your mentor will download it from your GitHub and will perform the assessment for you.

# Good Luck
